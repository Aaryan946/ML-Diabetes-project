all sub packages about using my diabetes  prediction ml model.
The main sub-packages commonly used in a diabetes prediction machine learning (ML) model include:
scikit-learn: For building ML models, preprocessing data, and performing tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, such as cleaning and preparing datasets.

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays needed in the computations.

Matplotlib: For visualization of data and results to understand model behavior.
AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoSklearn): To automate model selection and hyperparameter tunning.
Typical ML algorithms for diabetes prediction include Support  Random Forest, KNN. 
Additionally, a full ML pipeline would include modules for data preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment, sometimes using tools like Streamlit for interactive dashboards
Thus, the key sub-packages you would use for building a diabetes prediction
ML model are primarily in Python's data science ecosystem: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and optionally AutoML tools for efficiency in training and evaluation.
